- [ ] Go to [github.com](https://github.com) > click your profile picture (top right corner) > Your Profile
    * In the left sidebar tap "Edit profile" and set:
      - [ ] Profile picture. Use a real professional picture, a cartoon that represents you, or use some AI image tool to generate a cartoon version from a real photo of you.
            * Have no photo of you on the computer/web? Take a new photo or an existing one and upload it to [tmpfiles](https://tmpfiles.org/). The open upload URL on the computer.
            * Image tools:
               * Generate many different professional profile pictures from a real picture with [newprofilepic.com](https://newprofilepic.com/)
               * Cartoonize by [fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/)
               * Cartoon by [picsart](https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon/)
       - [ ] About me
       - [ ] Other data like links to social profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, ...)
- [ ] In the top right toolbar: click "+" > "New repository". Enter the following data:
    * Repository name: **exactly** the same name as your GitHub username.
    * Initialize this repository with: check "Add a README file"
    * Leave all others to default and press "Create repository".
- [ ] Edit your profile `README.md` in your new repo `https://github.com/your_username/your_username`
    - [ ] Copy the template
       * Click the :pencil2: icon on the `README.md` below the file list to start editing the file right in your browser.
         * Remember to publish your edits from time to time by pressing the "Commit changes" button in the top right corner.
       * Start with the template below. Copy it to your `README.md`.
    - [ ] Write about yourself! Use this Markdown syntax [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
       * Make good use of [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)
           e.g. `:computer:` -> :computer:
       * Add some badges to show your preferences:
           * https://home.aveek.io/GitHub-Profile-Badges/
           * https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile
       * Maybe you want to generate your own Octocat (GitHub logo animal) that represents you.
           * Generate at https://myoctocat.com/
           * Download the result and upload it to your profile repo in the browser. Go to your profile and locate the "Add file" button above the file list.
           * Insert the image in your README.md with something like `![My Octocat](my_octocat.png)`.
   - [ ] When done: make sure to run your text through a [spell checker](https://languagetool.org/). Paste in your whole Markdown text.
