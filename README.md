      - [x] Profile picture. Use a real professional picture, a cartoon that represents you, or use some AI image tool to generate a cartoon version from a real photo of you.
         * Have no photo of you on the computer/web? Take a new photo or an existing one and upload it to [tmpfiles](https://tmpfiles.org/). The open upload URL on the computer.
         * Image tools:
            * Generate many different professional profile pictures from a real picture with [newprofilepic.com](https://newprofilepic.com/)

       * Start with the template below. Copy it to your `README.md`.
    - [ ] Write about yourself! Use this Markdown syntax [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
       * Make good use of [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)
           e.g. `:computer:` -> :computer:
       * Add some badges to show your preferences:
           * https://home.aveek.io/GitHub-Profile-Badges/
           * https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile
       * Maybe you want to generate your own Octocat (GitHub logo animal) that represents you.
           * Generate at https://myoctocat.com/
           * Download the result and upload it to your profile repo in the browser. Go to your profile and locate the "Add file" button above the file list.
           * Insert the image in your README.md with something like `![My Octocat](my_octocat.png)`.
   - [ ] When done: make sure to run your text through a [spell checker](https://languagetool.org/). Paste in your whole Markdown text.
